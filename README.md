RP-TEST theme for Wordpress
==============

the RP theme is a trial task made by me , in order to show my knowledge and skills in Wordpress and PHP. 

Here will be a short documentation on how to use the theme as well as some tutorials.

Installation
------------
There are 2 ways to install the theme.

**Uploading in WordPress Dashboard**

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the themes dashboard
2. Navigate to the 'Upload Theme' area
3. Select `rp_test.zip` from your computer
4. Click 'Install Now'
5. Activate the theme

**Using FTP**

1. Download `rp_test.zip`
2. Extract the `rp_test` directory to your computer
3. Upload the `rp_test` directory to the `/wp-content/themes/` directory
4. Activate the Theme in the Theme dashboard


Setup theme
------------

After the theme is activated you have to setup the "Home page" and "Menu"
Otherwise you will have a chunky frontPage and one menu item "Home"

Now the theme after activation creates a page called "Home page " with the slug "rp_home".
Then it sets a static page in the theme settings using this page.
So you dont need to worry about creating pages and setting up the theme.

You need to add data to your "Home Page"
