RP-TEST theme for Wordpress
==============

the RP theme is a trial task made by me , in order to show my knowledge and skills in Wordpress and PHP. 

Here will be a short documentation on how to use the theme as well as some tutorials.

Installation
------------
There are 2 ways to install the theme.

**Uploading in WordPress Dashboard**

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the themes dashboard
2. Navigate to the 'Upload Theme' area
3. Select `rp_test.zip` from your computer
4. Click 'Install Now'
5. Activate the theme

**Using FTP**

1. Download `rp_test.zip`
2. Extract the `rp_test` directory to your computer
3. Upload the `rp_test` directory to the `/wp-content/themes/` directory
4. Activate the Theme in the Theme dashboard


Theme Setup
------------

After the theme is activated you have to setup the "Home page" and "Menu"
Otherwise you will have a chunky frontPage and one menu item "Home"

Now the theme after activation creates a page called "Home page " with the slug "rp_home".
Then it sets a static page in the theme settings using this page.
So you dont need to worry about creating pages and setting up the theme.

Home page setup
------------
The Home page is made of 4 customizable sections, each section requires some input from the admin in order to show a nice Home page.

###Home page banner section :

**Banner image:**

There is some recommended format for the image size , but even if you add a image that doesnt fit this recommendations the theme will auto resize the image keeping its proportions.

Recommended image size : 

  * width = 1920 px
  * height = 490 px

The headline is build up from 3 fields , but only the firs one is required (*)
